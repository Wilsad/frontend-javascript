### task_0: Creating an interface for a student

This project demonstrates the creation of a TypeScript interface for a `Student` object,
instantiation of student objects, and rendering them into an HTML table using Vanilla JavaScript.

**How to run:**

1. Navigate to the `0x04-TypeScript/task_0` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code and generate the `dist/bundle.js` and `dist/index.html` files.
4. Open the `dist/index.html` file in your web browser to view the output.

**Development Server:**
You can also run a development server with live-reloading:

1. Navigate to the `0x04-TypeScript/task_0` directory.
2. Run `npm install` (if not already done).
3. Run `npm run start-dev`. This will open your default browser and serve the application.
